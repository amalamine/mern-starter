# MERN Starter

## Running in dev natively

To run a development environment, you can use the `start-dev` command. This will start up a development web server on port 3000, and a nodemon-watched API server on port 3001. These development servers will automatically reload if changes are made to the source.

  - Install dependencies with:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

  - Start the development environment:

    ```
    npm run start-dev
    ```

## Running in prod natively

To run a production environment, you can use the `start-dev` command. This will start up a production web server on port 4000.

  - Install dependencies with:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

  - Build with:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

  - Start the development environment:

    ```
    npm run start-prod
    ```
